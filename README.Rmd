# hexSticker: create hexagon sticker in R

I write a script to create
[ggtree sticker](https://github.com/jotsetung/BioC-stickers/tree/master/ggtree)
purely in `R`. Laurent create the
[make_sticker](https://github.com/jotsetung/BioC-stickers/issues/12)
function based on my script and pack it to the
[sticker](https://github.com/lgatto/sticker) package.



I have some new ideas to add new features:

+ support base plot
+ support image file
+ etc.


To avoid breaking their existing code to make stickers, I create this
package for my own needs.
